Praise be to Cthulhu, united are we all in his quest to devour our souls
%
May he watch with satisfaction our eternal suffering
%
May we bask forever in the flame of his indifference
%
Hail Cthulhu, may he bathe in the screams of our agony in perpetuity
%
May the tendrils of his malevolence pull us into the storm of our insanity 
%
For whom all of our works are created, and necessarily destroyed
%
May this cage come down, but may we be forever caged by the divine ministration of his benevolent bloodlust. 
%
Day off is as good a day as any to offer to Cthulhu, may he rend the flesh from our bones and the joy from our hearts. 
%
Praise be to Cthulhu, he is the beginning and the end. He is the beginning and the end. He is the beginning and the end. 
%
May we feast of this watermelon, may he feast of this flesh.
